# ðŸ§  OS Microservices Simulation

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project simulates core operating system functionalities using microservices:
- **Memory Management** â€“ Handles allocation and deallocation of memory.
- **Process Scheduling** â€“ Simulation of algorithms like FCFS, Round Robin and SJF
- **Multithreading** â€“ Simulates thread creation, execution, and synchronization.

Each service is containerized with Docker and communicates via REST APIs.

## ðŸ§± Architecture



To visualise the microservices, download the zip file, navigate to the directory and build the container
Make sure Docker is installed and running:

docker-compose up --build
